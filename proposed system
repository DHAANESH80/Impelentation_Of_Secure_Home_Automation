This project proposes features such as:

❖ Smart Security: Controls security camera using motion detector sensor (The web
camera will automatically turn on when it detects the motion)

❖ Smart Irrigation System: Utilizes a water level sensor to regulate the amount of
water in the garden with a smart irrigation system (If the water level monitor displays above
10 then all the lawn sprinklers will automatically get turned on.)

❖ Smoke detection System: A alarm will sound to inform us that the smoke level is
high when it rises above 5, and the fire sprinklers will immediately turn on.

❖ Thermal Comfort: Thermostat is used to measure the temperature. Depending on the
environment, ceiling fans and air conditioners are automatically adjusted.

❖ Smart Alert System: Temperature of home is monitored and Email notification will
be sent if it reaches certain value.

❖ Remote Access Car: Controlling the car by PC or mobile connected to the network,
and registration server.
