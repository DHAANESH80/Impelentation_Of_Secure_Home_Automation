# Impelentation_Of_Secure_Home_Automation
In the past decade, the number of Internet-connected devices in the home has increased exponentially.
A smart home is a residence that uses advanced automation systems to provide a higher level of comfort, convenience, and security. A wide variety of devices can be controlled and monitored remotely using a smart home platform. 

Materials and Method: 
Smart homes typically use a wireless network to connect the various devices and sensors. 
The use of Wi-Fi is becoming more common, as it offers a wider range of capabilities than other protocols.
WPA2 is a security protocol that provides strong encryption AES. 
Implementing a smart home through WPA2 is a great way to keep your home safe, secure and authentication that will ensure that only authorized devices can access your network. 
Smart email alert system for the smart home to monitor and analyze data from connected devices in the home. 
This system can generate notifications via email to inform the user of changes in the home environment. 
This technology can help individuals to take appropriate actions to maintain a comfortable living space.

This project gives us a clear picture of the smart world by using the concept of IoT and creating a
secure home automation using a Cisco packet tracer 8.2.0 which contains various sensors and
actuators.
